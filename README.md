# DisAintThatGreatSaber
On my endless quest to port Beat Saber to every incompatible device out there, Discord reached out to their community to find the best bot known to all guild members. This was a calling. It was meant to be. It was time for Beat Saber to come to Discord! 



This will be no easy task but I am willing to take it for the future of Discord! You may already have some questions such as:
- But, Darkchaos, can't you only fit like 5 emojis per line? How you going to fit Beat Saber into one discord message?
- But, Darkchaos, doesn't Discord rate limit how much bots can edit messages so it will run at like 3fps?
- But, Darkchaos, surely playing a rhythm game on a cloud server will add unplayable delay?
- But, Darkchaos, why did you choose such an edgy username when your actually a mad pu$$y?
- But, Darkchaos, why did you use JavaScript if you hate the language so much?
- But, Darkchaos, don't you have other projects you should be working on at this time?




To that, I say:

# Welcome to Beat Saber for Discord!

## Usage:
```
node bot.js
```

disclaimer:
