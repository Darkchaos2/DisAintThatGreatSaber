# DisAintThatGreatSaber
On my endless quest to port Beat Saber to every incompatible device out there, Discord reached out to their community to find the best bot known to all guild members. This was a calling. It was meant to be. It was time for Beat Saber to come to Discord! 



This will be no easy task but I am willing to take it for the future of Discord! You may already have some questions such as:
- But, Darkchaos, can't you only fit like 5 emojis per line? How you going to fit Beat Saber into one discord message?
- But, Darkchaos, doesn't Discord rate limit how much bots can edit messages so it will run at like 3fps?
- But, Darkchaos, surely playing a rhythm game on a cloud server will add unplayable delay?
- But, Darkchaos, why did you choose such an edgy username when your actually a mad pu$$y?
- But, Darkchaos, why did you use JavaScript if you hate the language so much?
- But, Darkchaos, don't you have other projects you should be working on at this time?




To that, I say:

# Welcome to Beat Saber for Discord!

## Setup
Add your bot's token in /settings/botDetails.js

### Usage:
```
node bot.js
```

### Commands:
```
play [song] - searches BeatSaver for a song and converts it into a discord readable format
test - loads test data, bit boring tbh with you :P
```

## How to "play":
When a beat comes up, react with the corresponding beat.

Could potenially use some macros, if you are feeling fancy ;) https://twitter.com/discordapp/status/1125875093077315584

## Wishlist
As the time draws near (currently 4 hours away from deadline at 4am in the morning), it is becoming more apparent that i will not be able to add everything i wanted to. This joke project seems a bit lackluster without the memes and extra feature so wanted to mention the missing features regardless.

Hounourable missing feature mentions:
- Knucles / Tails shouting blue / red laser on blue / red lighting events
- Knucles shouting oh no on beat miss
- slash sfx on slash
- settings menu to turn off shouting knucles
- slash visual effects
- growing beats from the distance
- less shitty ui

~~# NOTICE
Oh no, bit of an oopsie. The bot uses static references to emojis in my server. if you want to host your own bot, it will need to be a member of this server. durp :S
i cant roll a patch out for a few days as this week is very busy for me. this is a really bad idea but here is an ivote to the server, feel free to add your bot to it to get the emojis.~~

Patch has been pushed that should fix this. I'm still going to my server open so you can use the emojis though
